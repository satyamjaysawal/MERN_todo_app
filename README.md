2.Install the following dependencies using the command npm install:

express: A backend web framework for Node.js
mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool
cors: A package for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.js
react: A frontend library for building user interfaces
react-dom: A package for rendering React components in the browser
axios: A package for making HTTP requests from the frontend

3.Create a new file called server.js and add the following code to create a basic Express.js server:
